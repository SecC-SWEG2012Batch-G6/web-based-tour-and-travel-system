The Hummer H2 is a large SUV that was marketed by Hummer and built in the AM General facility under contract from General Motors from 2002 to 2009. It is based on a modified GMT820 Chevrolet 2500 HD in front and 1500 frame in back. A four-door pickup truck version with a midgate that opens the vehicle's interior to the external cargo bed was introduced for 2005 as the H2 SUT (sport utility truck).[3]

In 2001 and 2002, GM allowed journalists to examine early versions of the Hummer H2, which were still under development at the time.[4][5]

The H2 was built by AM General under contract with General Motors at AM General Military Assembly Plant in Mishawaka, Indiana.

2008 updates
For 2008, the Hummer H2 and H2 SUT received an update. While largely unchanged on the exterior, the H2 and H2 SUT interiors were redesigned. This included new instrument cluster with improved gauges and Driver Information Center (DIC), a new leather-wrapped steering wheel, three new radios with a Bose premium audio system and auxiliary audio inputs (including a new touchscreen GPS navigation radio with DVD audio and video playback while in park, and XM Nav-Traffic capabilities), a new rear seat DVD entertainment system, Bluetooth hands-free calling capabilities, enhanced voice activation, new OnStar hardware with buttons moved from the rearview mirror to the overhead console, a lower dashboard-mounted radio, new dual-zone climate controls, new rear seat audio system controls, a new dash-mounted control knob for the 4X4 system to replace the old pushbutton controls, brushed aluminum interior trim panels, new interior color options, available remote engine start, and a center dashboard-mounted analog clock.

Also for 2008, a new 393-horsepower, 6.2 L V8 gasoline engine replaced the old 325-horsepower, 6.0 L V8 gasoline unit, with a new "6L80-E" six-speed automatic transmission replaced the old "4L65-E" four-speed automatic unit.

Hummer launched a special 2009 Black Chrome Limited Edition featuring a new paint color, Sedona Metallic. All Black Chrome editions also had Sedona interior, black chrome accents instead of standard chrome, and unique 20 inch black chrome wheels. Initially there were to be 1000-1300 Black Chrome editions made. However due to production shutdown mid-year only 6 of them were ever actually made, and they were never made available to the public.

Fuel economy
General Motors is not required to provide official fuel economy ratings for the H2 due to the vehicle's heavy gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).[9][10] Prior to 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) exempted vehicles with a GVWR over 8,500 lb (3,900 kg) from fuel economy standards and testing.[11]
