			 <p>
				<h3><q>Invite Ethipia's heritages to the world</q></h3>
				4HF_tour_and_travel is a company aimed at designing a website to addres the important features of the attractive palces in Ethipia
				to introduce Ethiopia both for the local and abroad tourists. This website helps the passengers to trace their journey and arrange the
				necessary things for the tour, and give a well organized information about the places where they are going to go.

		     <h2>Motivations</h2>
			<p>
			Tourism in Ethiopia is one of the economic assets in the country. It accounts 5.5% of the gross domestic product. Although many of us may have been tourist, 
			it is hard to define the word tourism. Tourism includes activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure,
			business or other purposes.
			</p>
			 <ul>A few years before peoples were exposed to many difficulties when they plan to go somewhere else due:-
			 <li>lack information,</li>
			 <li>costly and tedious bureaucracy to get the services,</li>
			 <li>Inaccessibility</li>
			 <li>Time consuming</li>
			 <li>And even on the online systems there are lots of limitations</li>
			 </ul>
			<p>
			 These problems make some countries like Ethiopia to be unknown and hinders from gaining the revenue from the tourism sector because of the lack accessibility to the world.   
			</p>
			<p>
			  Now a day’s, peoples around the world are getting familiar with the internet and web based applications. So it will be easier for both 
			  the agencies and customers to plan activities online than going to agencies. In this century organizations which are modern are more 
			  preferred because they make their customers happy or easily satisfied without much effort and additional money and work as fast as 
			  possible to satisfy their customer’s needs. As mentioned above, tour and travel accounts for economic development of the country, 
			  it will be easier not only for peoples living in Ethiopia but also for tourists outside Ethiopia. As the web design plays major role 
			  for first impression of the agency or the customers we were motivated to build this website beautifully and effectively. So the problems
			  listed above triggers as to take our part in this area to simplify these inhibitors as much as possible.     
			</p>
			
			<h2>Vision</h2>
			
			<p>
			   In the near future seeing the customers can get Ethiopia easily, Ethipia to be one of the tourism center, and
